## Prerequisites

**Note:** This is a version under development of PeanutsJS. Documentation is still under refinement. For the current stable version please visit [PeanutsJS stable](https://github.com/alorozco22/peanutsjs-stable).

Before locally developing your server with *PeanutsJS* check that you have installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (recommended).
* To deploy your web app to Heroku, you will need the Heroku CLI, follow the [Deployment section](#deployment) for more details.


## Hello World (Getting Started)

To start a **Hello World** web app running *PeanutsJS* on your computer:

1. clone *PeanutsJS* minimal server repository into your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/alorozco22/peanutsjs.git
```

Define your app information by editing the package.json file in the root of your app:

```js
{
  "name": "PeanutsJS",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "MVC Nodejs server. Minimal and expandable.",
  "main": "01-main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"No test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Alfredo Eleazar Orozco Quesada <ae.orozco10@uniandes.edu.co>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "ejs": "^3.0.1",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "path": "^0.12.7"
  }
}

```

Now, place your command prompt or terminal inside your *PeanutsJS* directory and install the required dependencies:

```
cd peanutsjs
npm install
```

Finally, execute your server with:

```
node 01-main.js
```

Your home page should be visible at [http://localhost:4004/](http://localhost:4004/).


## Introduction

*PeanutsJS* is my own implementation of the Model-View-Controller ([MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)) concept in Node.js. It is an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) based server with MVC architecture. It employs [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) databases to store persistent data and authentication information with hashed passwords. It's clearly organized to use [EJS](https://ejs.co/) templates engine. You can run it locally, deploy it to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or to any other [PASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) as with any other web app.

With *PeanutsJS* you will be able to:

* Create **static websites** to serve pages. *(However, if this is your purpose, you may want to check out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a simpler solution).*
* Develop **interactive websites** with forms, dynamic content, etc.
* **Authentication systems** to select displayed contents to different users, and **persistent sessions**.
* You will have absolute flexibility to edit pages, styles, elements, and requests handling, etc. You could even [create a platformer](https://youtu.be/FGxdoHezkks?t=393), or a [real time multiplayer](http://buildnewgames.com/real-time-multiplayer/) within *PeanutsJS*.


😉 **Target audience:** *PeanutsJS* is a learning-by-doing environment for those who want to explore Node.js or back-end development in general. The server can be used as a template for developing organized modularized and sustainably expandable web apps. It also provides the files structure to illustrate in a minimal example the relationship between server, authentication and data storage.

⚠️ Note you should feel somehow comfortable with asynchronous javascript: particularly [Promises](https://www.promisejs.org/) syntax before working with *PeanutsJS*. You should also be familiar with basic web development tools: html, css, js. If you wish to perform database queries, you should know a litle bit of SQL language. Nevertheless, you will always find tons of information in youtube, documentation, etc. about the very specifics.

## Model View Controller

Model View Controller (MVC) is a concept related to how to organize code in self-contained modules with clear responsibilities. This makes the process of increasing functionality easy and viable. You will find a lot of information about it in the web. However, how to implement the concept may be confusing at first glance. MVC can be applied to many contexts; and, there are many ways of implementing MVC. *PeanutsJS* follows the next pattern for the web development context:

![MVC](./04-doc/MVC-organized.png)

1. The **user** interacts directly with the web browser.
1. The browser makes a **request** to the app or emits some order under some information protocol.
1. The **Router** is a .js file. It has a reference to the **express server** (app), so it declares the functions associated to every request in the app, and to the **controller**, so it calls the correspondent function defined inside it.
1. The **Controller** is another .js module. It receives as parameters the request and response objects from the router. The controller asks the models to process the request's data.
1. The **Models** are divided into separate .js files. Thereby, the logic and data handling of the app can be easily modularized in manageable, self-contained files. A function in a model **returns** the processed data to the controller.
1. Once the controller has the processed information, it **renders, sends a file, etc.** to display to the user from the views via the response object. These are simple html, css, ejs and client javascript files.
1. Finally, the browser **displays** the rendered file or response to the user.

The 01-main.js file initializes the references between each module once the server is started, so they can communicate between themselves.







## Installing

Empty *PeanutsJS* template does not include preconfigured routes. You will have to add follow the instructions for [adding a new page](./04-doc/add-new-page.md).

To use *PeanutsJS* locally, first configure your environment. Please follow the next steps:

1. [Install mySQL server and Workbench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u96rVINbAUI) if you are using a database.
1. Remember to download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
1. You may need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as well to clone the repository, and eventually to deploy to Heroku.

Next, clone empty *PeanutsJS* repository into your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/alorozco22/peanutsjs-empty.git
```

Now, place your command prompt inside your *PeanutsJS* directory and install the required dependencies:

```
cd peanutsjs-empty
npm install
```

You may have to configure your database connection if you want to use it. Please **create a .env file** in the root folder of your server. Edit the contents of the file following the [example for a dotEnv file](Example-dotEnv.txt).

In the 01-main.js file you should uncomment the correspondent lines related to database and session storage.

To allow connections to the database via Node.js, you may have to execute the next query within your workbench:

```
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '[myPassword]'
```
Replace *[myPassword]* with your own password for connecting to the database.

Configure your app information by editing the package.json file in the root of your app:

```js
{
  "name": "PeanutsJS", // NAME OF YOUR APP
  "version": "1.0.0", // VERSION
  "description": "MVC Framework for Nodejs server, using EJS, and mySQL database.", // DESCRIPTION
  "main": "01-main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Alfredo Eleazar Orozco Quesada <ae.orozco10@uniandes.edu.co>", // AUTHOR
  "license": "MIT", // LICENSE
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "csurf": "^1.10.0",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "ejs": "^3.0.1",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-mysql-session": "^2.1.0",
    "express-session": "^1.17.0",
    "mysql": "^2.17.1",
    "path": "^0.12.7"
  }
}

```

Install your dependencies by running: 

```
npm install
```

Finally, execute your server with:

```
node 01-main.js
```

You should be able to see the life demo in your [localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004/).

## Deployment

You can deploy to any service you prefere. I use Heroku, the free service is enough for many apps. To deploy to heroku, please follow [this article](./04-doc/deployment.md). 

Follow the next article to find [general information](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs) on how to deploy Node.js to Heroku.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Javascript Runtime
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node.js
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database 
* [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - Templating language

Every asynchronous instruction is written in native [Promises](https://www.promisejs.org/) syntax.
